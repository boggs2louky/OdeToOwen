# OdeToOwen

Front End Web Development Course with Code Louisville

## First attempt at a HTML webpage

This site was created as a gift for my girlfriend Carrie, who's beloved Beagle Owen passed this past Sept 3, 2021. The intent of the page is meant as a memorial to Owen who was dearly loved and will be forever missed.  The HTML/CSS/JS page is simple Grid layout with flexbox being called (section B) with media queries from the CSS.

No special instructions are required for the reviewer to run your project. It has been tested on a secondary computer and mobile phone.
The readme should be called readme.md or readme.txt and located in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project on GitHub:

Requirements:
Choose at least 1 item on the CSS Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 item off the list of JavaScript Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 additional item from any of the lists below and implement it in your project

Project Features found in the Project:

CSS FEATURES LIST

● A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes,
such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by
clicking the “hamburger” icon 

● Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.
Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes
does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced
feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a
desktop.


JAVASCRIPT FEATURES LIST

● Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the
correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example,
display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a
section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the
page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.
