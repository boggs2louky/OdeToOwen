Need to add the:

A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is about.....

Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project
The readme should be called readme.md or readme.txt and located in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project on GitHub
Choose at least 1 item on the CSS Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 item off the list of JavaScript Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 additional item from any of the lists below and implement it in your project

CSS FEATURES LIST

● A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes,
such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by
clicking the “hamburger” icon

● Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.
Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes
does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced
feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a
desktop.

● Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example,
change the background color for every other row in a table

● Perform a Web Accessibility Compliance review on your own site and document all the
tools and testing you used to verify your site is accessible. This may involve a written
write-up, screenshots, and other ways of showing that you evaluated your site for
accessibility compliance. Include the report in your GitHub repository.

● Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu
animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you
will have to research this on your own

● Create a custom video player with at least one custom element (such as the progress
bar, play button, etc). This is also not covered in the required Treehouse content.

● Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to
see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.


JAVASCRIPT FEATURES LIST

● Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the
correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example,
display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a
section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the
page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.

● Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation
(calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value
to do something on the site.

● Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the
contents of some or all of the array on your page

● Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example
displaying a number of list items "< li >" based on how many times you loop

● Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display
the values somewhere on your page

● Create one or more JavaScript objects (such as with multiple values contained in { }’s),
modify at least one value of that object, and display it on your site

● Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button
or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.

● Allow the user to rearrange or move items by clicking and dragging an element on your
site

● Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to
see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.
