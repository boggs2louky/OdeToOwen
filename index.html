                            <p>Owen was a creature of comfort and always liked to snuggle in beds/couches/doggy beds,
                                anywhere he could find a nice warm and inviting place. He was not one for toys though...

                            <p>Owen was indifferent to most dogs and kept to himself. Earlier in life he would encounter
                                dogs of friends and family but was not one to get excited about other dogs on walks or
                                when brought into his home. He tolerated other dogs but was not keen to be with them. He
                                preferred being with his owner and sleeping in bed with her.</p>

                <p>Owen never barked and never cried, not a whimper nor a sigh. Loving creature of comfort and hungry
                    till the end. A beagle who always was a friend. The day he passed is the day an eye can never be
                    dry. Leaving a hole in hearts that can never be filled.</p>
